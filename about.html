        <section>

            <p>If you're here, there might be a few things to know about me.</p>
            <p>
                First, I'm a software developer.
                For the past few years, I've worked for <a href="https://www.oracle.com/applications/primavera/solutions/products.html#prime">Oracle Primavera</a>.
                Before that, I went to school at <a href="http://www.rit.edu/gccis/">RIT</a> for Software Engineering.
                I heartily approve of folks sharing their <a href="https://github.com/wyantb/Settings/blob/master/vimrc">dotfiles</a> on github, because I like pilfering new ideas.
                Presumably, I've also done <a href="https://github.com/WhoopInc/frozen-moment/issues/1">one</a> or <a href="https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/2303">two</a> other things on github as well.
                I guess I also have a <a href="http://lnkd.in/d7WinF4">Linkedin</a> account you could use for looking at some of my other history and projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm also an avid student of different topics in psychology - my minor at RIT was in psychology.
                Among other things, I'm amazed that there's so many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">biases</a> in human behaviors and belief.
                Indeed, I wonder how I could - if I could - <a href="http://rationality.org/checklist/">promote non-biased behavior</a> in my own life.
                But of course, that's a massively <a href="https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/">long-term</a> kind of project.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lately, I have no less interest in philosphy than I do psychology.
                I've been a student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_Zen">Zen</a> for quite some time.
                And Ia student of <a href="http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/stoicismtoday/category/uncategorized/stoic-week/">ancient Stoicism</a> - of Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and a framework of thought founded by those long since dead.
                Having all this information online - having entire <a href="http://palousemindfulness.com/selfguidedMBSR.html">programs</a> out there for free - in my opinion, demonstrates the promise of the internet.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've lived, since my graduation, in Philadelphia.
                Moving here, I wanted to live somewhere I could get away without a car - indeed, <a href="http://iseptaphilly.com/">I SEPTA Philly</a>.
                My time here has been good to me, but lately I've been <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b2KYuqHJbJvnyAxi9lGBEANvaeWu8WeBxJoB1Vh6N1g/edit?usp=sharing">forming new plans</a>.
                It's quite simple, really: when I <a href="http://www.dancingrabbit.org/visit-dancing-rabbit-ecovillage/visitor-program/">visit a place</a> and walk away impressed, I have reason to think about the structure of my life.
            </p>

            <p>
                All this, and I haven't even mentioned...
                I really enjoy rock climbing and frisbee.
                Such great sports.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, I guess that's what I've got to say.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for reading!
            </p>
