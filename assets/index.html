            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my personal site!</p>
            <p>
                True, this is a simple, minimal start.
                I make few claims, at the moment, to anything fancy here.
                Instead, I simply want to talk about this site itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a project in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>.
                I find it a pretty interesting language, just with a name that isn't ideal.
                I'm supposed to Google for "Go"?
                "Golang" helps, but...
                The name really gets me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law_of_triviality">bikeshedding</a> about naming.
                Sigh.  Is what it is.
            </p>

            <p>
                Anyway, one of the reasons I find Go interesting is simply how easy it was to get <a href="https://github.com/wyantb/site">this site</a> up and running.
                I'm using <a href="http://echo.labstack.com/">Echo</a>, "A fast and unfancy micro web framework for Go".
                Yet even with features in my server.go file that I'm not making use of, the initial server implementation took 64 lines of code. has http method and path logging, responds in microseconds.
                It's ridiculously more than I need for a trivial blog/personal project, and it's awesome.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another shoutout goes to <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/">scaleway</a>, my hosting provider.
                ARM-based servers, 2GB of RAM, 50GB of SSD storage...
                And their <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/faq/server/">"C1 server is smaller than a credit card and consumes only a few watts"</a>.
                Once again, this is ridiculously more than I need for a trivial blog/personal project, and it's awesome.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ultimately, one of my goals for my site is to use it as a kind of serving ground for some basic visualizations.
                For example, I'm vaguely curious about how much energy the <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/large-commercial-building-energy-benchmarking/resource/5828217c-26ad-4ecb-921a-2cfabe147f47<F37>">commercial buildings in Philly</a> use.
                But while that raw data is, I'm sure, perfectly good, I can't really visualize it and compare to what I use in the same timeframe.
                So it'd be an interesting exercise to me to start grabbing some datasets, <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a>, and get to work rendering some graphs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, as to this site itself.
                It uses Google Analytics, and I'm told that I'm totally supposed to point you to <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">a page</a> explaining how Google uses cookies.
                So there you go.
                If you're interested, you can of course check out the complete source <a href="https://github.com/wyantb/site">on github</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Humble beginnings here.
                It'll probably stay that way.
                Or maybe I really will do something cool.
                Who knows?
            </p>
